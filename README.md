## Welcome to Switchy
I am a tiny jQuery plugin that firstly aims to transform a standard &lt;select&gt; in a beautiful switchy element.
Please have a look to what I am about at [http://lou.github.com/switchy/](http://lou.github.com/switchy/ "That is what I am about")

But wait! I can do a lot more if you play nice with me.


### Basic Example

You put your standard &lt;select&gt; in your HTML with as many &lt;option&gt; as you want.
```html
<select id="switch-me">
  <option value="female">female</option>
  <option value="male">male</option>
</select>
```

In your Javascript you can invoke the magic switchy method
```javascript
$('#switch-me').switchy();
```
